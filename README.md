# code-cleaner

Maybe you have experienced that sometimes you copy a code from somewhere to paste it in your computer and run it. But in some websites they have placed the line numbers in such a way that when you copy the code the line numbers are also copied. You can remove these with this program.

You can also remove python shell prompts (>>> and ...) from python codes.
